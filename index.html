There are many types of monsters in this world,<br> monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble.<br>Monsters who abduct children, monsters who devour dreams,<br>monsters who suck blood, and monsters who always tell lies.<br>Lying monsters are a real nuisance. They are much more cunning than other monsters.<br>They pose as humans, even though they have no understanding of the human heart.<br>They eat, even though they've never experienced hunger.<br>They study even though the have no interest in academics.<br>They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love.<br>If I were to encounter such a monster, I would likely be eaten by it<br>because, in truth, <b>I am that monster.</b>
